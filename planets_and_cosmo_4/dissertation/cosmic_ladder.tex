% Introduction to Hubble's constant and it's importance
A precisely determined Hubble's constant $H_0$ would have an overarching effect on any feature of cosmological theory: the age or critical density of the Universe, or with the formation of cosmic structure. Producing a conclusive value for $H_0$ is difficult as absolute distances on the cosmic scale are difficult to measure. Inhomogeneous gravitational acceleration generates motion which does not follow the simple expansion as described by Hubble's Law $v=H_0 d$. An uncertainty arises due to the discrepancy between the methods to connect local distances to the smooth large-scale Hubble flow \citep{fukugita_cosmic}. \\

% Cosmic distance ladder and cosmic paths
Several approaches for cosmic distance measurement should therefore be used to reduce systematic errors. These measurements can form the ``rungs'' of a \textit{cosmic distance ladder}, where large extragalactic distances ($>1000$ Mpc) are informed and calibrated by techniques which have smaller ranges \citep{carroll_astro}. Astronomers may employ a variety of methods in tandem, therefore the ladder could instead be expressed as several pathways (Figure \ref{fig:cosmic_pathways}).

\captionof{figure}[Cosmic Distance Pathways]{Adapted from \cite{jacoby_extragal}, this diagram illustrates the various approaches to calculate $H_0$, each technique is roughly placed at the approximate range it operates at. One can see that there is not one strict ``cosmic ladder'', rather multiple pathways. For reference, the acronyms used are: B-W - Baade-Wessenlink; GCLF - Globular-Cluster Luminosity Function; LSC - Local Super Cluster; PNLF - Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function; SBF - Surface-Brightness Fluctuations; SG - Super Giant; SN - Supernovae; $\pi$ - parallax.}

% HST Key Project
The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) $H_0$ Key Project was an effort in the early 2000s to determine $H_0$ by calculating distances to Cepheid variables in local galaxies ($\le 20$ Mpc) then applying them as a calibration to 5 secondary independent distance indicators. Described by \cite{freedman_hstkeystone}, four of the methods (Type Ia supernovae, Tully-Fisher relation, surface-brightness fluctuations, and Type II supernovae) were able to produce $70\le H_0 \le72$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and the remaining technique (fundamental plane for elliptical galaxies) $H_0\approx82$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Over the next decade, the methodology would be refined and the sample of Cepheids and Type Ia supernovae improved (better observations and other data types) $H_0=73.48 \pm1.66$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ \citep{2011ApJ...730..119R, 2016ApJ...826...56R, 2018ApJ...855..136R}. These results set a standard benchmark for $H_0$, they were found by taking steps along the cosmic ladder and whilst they have high accuracy, it would be beneficial to directly calculate $H_0$ at large distances without the need for Cepheid-based calibration. \\

% CMB anisotropies, Planck
One alternative is measuring Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Through analysing all-sky temperature and polarisation maps, $\Lambda$CDM cosmology models can be applied which constrain cosmological parameters. Surveys of the CMB have included those performed by the spacecraft COBE, WMAP, and more recently, Planck. The results of the latter include $H_0=67.5\pm0.5$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ \citep{2018arXiv180706209P}, this is of particular importance as it is discrepant when compared to the most recent HST-based result \citep{2018ApJ...855..136R}. Investigations of potential systematics in either methods have concluded that some arise due to the modelling of the Cepheids \citep{2018MNRAS.477.4534F} and residual systematics from certain spectra used in the Planck likelihood calculation \citep{2015PhRvD..91b3518S}. However the tension between the $H_0$ values still exists, therefore it would be beneficial to explore other methods for calculating the constant. \\

% Sunyaevâ€“Zel'dovich effect and Chandra X-ray
The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) is an effect which leads to a change in the apparent brightness of the CMB towards a cluster of galaxies or for any reservoir of hot plasma \citep{1999PhR...310...97B}. Employed with X-ray
