A precisely determined Hubble's constant $H_0$ would have an overarching effect on any feature of cosmological theory: the age of the Universe, the critical density of the Universe, or in the formation of cosmic structure. Producing a conclusive value for $H_0$ is difficult as absolute distances on the cosmic scale are difficult to measure. Inhomogeneous gravitational acceleration generates motion which does not follow the simple expansion as described by Hubble's Law $v=H_0 d$. An uncertainty arises due to the discrepancy between the methods to connect local distances to the smooth large-scale Hubble flow \citep{fukugita_cosmic}. \\

Several approaches for cosmic distance measurement should therefore be used to reduce systematic errors. These measurements can form the ``rungs'' of a \textit{cosmic distance ladder}, where large extragalactic distances ($>1000$ Mpc) are informed and calibrated by techniques which have smaller ranges \citep{carroll_astro}. Astronomers may employ a variety of methods in tandem, therefore the ladder could instead be expressed as several pathways (Figure \ref{fig:cosmic_pathways}).

\captionof{figure}[Cosmic Distance Pathways]{Adapted from \cite{jacoby_extragal}, this diagram illustrates the various approaches to calculate $H_0$, each technique is roughly placed at the approximate range it operates at. One can see that there is not one strict ``cosmic ladder'', rather multiple pathways. For reference, the acronyms used are: B-W - Baade-Wessenlink; GCLF - Globular-Cluster Luminosity Function; LSC - Local Super Cluster; PNLF - Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function; SBF - Surface-Brightness Fluctuations; SG - Super Giant; SN - Supernovae; $\pi$ - parallax.}

The Hubble Space Telescope $H_0$ Key Project was an effort in the early 2000s to determine $H_0$ by calculating distances to Cepheid variables in local galaxies ($\le 20$ Mpc) then applying them as a calibration to 5 secondary independent distance indicators. Described by \cite{freedman_hstkeystone}, four of the methods (Type Ia supernovae, Tully-Fisher relation, surface-brightness fluctuations, and Type II supernovae) were able to produce $70\le H_0 \le72$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and the remaining technique (fundamental plane for elliptical galaxies) $H_0=82$ kms$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. These results in particular set an initial benchmark for $H_0$, they were found by taking steps along the cosmic pathways and whilst they have high accuracy, it would be beneficial to directly calculate $H_0$ at large distances. \\
