# Part 3: Changes in the Earth-Sun orbit over the past 5 Myr

- Comparing the eccentricity data to the foram data, we don't see the same frequency of waves. 

- Between the eccentricity and precessional index data, there appears to be a similar general trend in their profiles. We want to explore of the cyclic nature of the orbit data has any effect on the marine data. 

- Let's take from 5Myr to 4Myr:
	- The foram data contains about 27 peaks 
	- The eccentricity data contains 11 peaks
	- Obliquity contains 25 peaks 
	- Perihelion longitude contains 49 peaks

Now using Excel and not Python to overlay and compare the data

## Eccentricity
First of all I am comparing the 5Myr to 4Myr period as the orbital data does not include any data older than 5Myr whereas the foram data does. At approximately 4.1Myr and 4.6Myr there are 'similar' features within both sets of data i.e. a peak at both points. However within the foram data, the peak is one of several. 

From 4Myr to 3Myr, there appears to be again, similar regions where peaks are located which could indicate that the foram and eccentricity data could be potentially correlated.
	
Changing the range to 2Myr to 3Myr, from 2.55Myr to 2.65Myr we could strongly argue that there could potentially be a correlation as both foram and eccentricity data have a double peak profile at around the same time - we must admit that the second peak for the eccentricity data appears to be slightly offset. 
	
Similarly, from 2.1 to 2.35Myr the dips in the data appear to match up - whilst the foram data has a higher resolution, we could further reinforce the idea of a correlation with these features
	
Shifting to 1Myr to 2Myr, we can again see that there are instances between the foram and orbital data where peaks and troughs match up. This does suggest that a relationship between the marine data and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.
	
It is difficult to form a final conclusion as there does not appear to be an exact match-up between data features - there is a slight offset which may be due to data/model precision or accuracy. If we had uncertainties available for either sets of data we would then be able to form a stronger judgment on correlation of the data.
	
Finally, for the current epoch to 1Myr, we can once again argue that there is a correlation due to similar data profiles. 
	
In conclusion then, there appears to be a potential correlation between the foram and eccentricity data. However it is difficult to be sure as the frequency and amplitude of the waves are different enough to form a solid judgment. 


## Obliquity 
Upon defining a smaller range of 5Myr to 4Myr we can immediately see that the peaks of both data sets do match up and we can suggest that there is a definite correlation between both marine data and the obliquity. Whereas eccentricity had one or two peaks within a range which would match, foram vs. obliquity contains ~11 peaks which align extremely well. 

At 4Myr to 3Myr this apparent relationship appears to be lost now - it almost appears like the obliquity data could fit, but it appears to be time-shifted by an amount to offset that fitting. 

3yr to 2Myr we are moving to the range where the foram peaks are less frequent. There does not appear to be a strong relationship between the data in this region as no peaks or troughs are matching up.

2Myr to 1Myr, both data sets are sinusoidal - the obliquity data more so than the marine. We could suggest that the increases and decreases could be a relationship, but that would be a stretch of the current data. 

1Myr to 0Myr, the frequency of the foram compared to the obliquity is substantially different - there is constant structure for the obliquity. However, it appears that the amplitude for the obliquity has increased. This could be a potential reason as to why the foram data has greater periods and amplitude now. 

For the obliquity data, there appeared to be a strong initial correlation between itself and the foram data. However as we moved throughout the rest of the data we found that the relationship broke down as there appeared to be a lack of similar features. But, we do notice that the obliquity data spans a greater amplitude between the 0 o 0.7Myr period which could be related to the greater period and increased amplitude of the foram data. 

## Perihelion longitude
Looking at 5Myr to 4Myr. First of all we see that whilst the perihelion data appears to have a constant and regular profile of peaks and troughes. We do see that there are occasional points where the period between peaks is larger. This greater peak does appear to have an influence on the foram data. The first of these deviations is at around 4.8Myr, we see that both foram and perihelion data share a change in profile shape. Then at 4.4Myr there appears to be something similar. Finally at 4.15Myr. 

4Myr to 3Myr. Again, the perihelion data is periodic but it appears that there are instances where the period increases ar some points (or even decreases), that then appears to hae an affect on the foram data. However from the data it appears that the perihelion has no strong affect on the amplitude of the foram data. 

3Myr to 2Myr. Now there is no clear indication that the periheilion data has an affect on the form data. The former appears to maintain a constant-enough periodicity for the foram data to not appear to be varied. 

2Myr to 1Myr. It's not clear as to whether both sets of data are correlated. There are some instances where when the data of one decreases, the other does so as well (e.g. at ~1.9Myr is one example). In saying that, there is again some potential relation as when the perihelion period increases there is a matching closing 'moment' for the foram data as well.

1Myr to 0Myr. The perihelion data appears to be constant in peridiocity and amplitude and there doesn't appear to be any matching features in the foram data.

We conclude then, there is some correlation but again it can only be seen in the earlier periods. Once we move past the 6Myr to 4Myr period, there are no discernible matching features between both sets of data.

## Conclusion
