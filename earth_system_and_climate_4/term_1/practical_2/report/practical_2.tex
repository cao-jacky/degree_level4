\title{Testing the Milankovitch-Croll hypothesis using $\delta^{18}$O foram data}

The Milankovitch-Croll hypothesis suggests that changes in the Earth's orbit around the Sun leads to changes in the Earth's planetary climate through fluctuations in solar insolation \cite{ruddiman_climate}. The exploration of this hypothesis can be performed by analysing proxy data, deep ocean sediment cores, paired together with Earth orbital data. Sediment cores provide a way to show the global temperature fluctuations and global ice volue across Earth's history. They contain a trace, namely the $\delta^{18}$O ratio in the foram shells \cite{droxler_climate}. \\

Defined from laboratory experiments, a $\sim 5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ temperature increase leads to an $\sim 1$\textperthousand\ decrease in the $\delta^{18}$O ratio. As ice-sheets melt, more $^{16}$O is released into the oceans, thus reducing the ratio. Sediment core data for an early and late period of Earth's history (Fig. \ref{fig:foram_data}) shows that in the more recent age the temperature had been shifting more dramatically as the amplitude of the $\delta^{18}$O had been varying more considerably than from 4 Myr to 5 Myr. This would have lead to longer periods of cooling and with a cooler climate, there would be a larger amount of global ice. In both sets of $\delta^{18}$O data, there features a sinusoidal-like trend, albeit the historical data has a smaller amplitude. This suggests that the glacial-interglacial events are a normal part of Earth's planetary climate cycle and could be related to the cyclical Earth-Sun orbital relationship. \\

In looking at the astrophysical data there are three concepts to consider: (i) eccentricity, (ii) precession, and (iii) obliquity. The former describes the ellipticity of the Earth's orbit around the Sun \cite{carroll_astro}, it's effect on insolation however is not entirely independent as the eccentricity also depends on the orbital angle between the solstices and the position of perihelion/aphelion. A precessional index value can be produced with $\chi= \varepsilon \sin{\omega}$, where $\varepsilon$ is the eccentricity and $\omega$ is the angle. Finally the obliquity can be defined as the value which describes the degree of tilt of the Earth's axis. \\

With these definitions in mind, we can proceed to evaluate and verify that our orbital data agrees with literature by applying two statistical analysis techniques. The first tool is \textit{wavelet analysis} (WA), by using the WA tool in PAST3 \cite{past3} heatmaps (Fig. \ref{fig:wa_orbital_data}) can be obtained which contain the dominant frequencies from a dataset. The second technique to employ is \textit{REDFIT} analysis, frequencies (Fig. \ref{fig:d18o_redfit}) can be picked out by finding peaks which have a height greater than a $95\%$ confidence interval. \\

Processing the orbital data with these two tools we can obtain results (Table \ref{table:final_results}) which have an average $\sim 96 \%$ agreement when compared with literature wavelengths. Knowing that the methods are valid and that they produce accurate results, the $\delta^{18}$O foram data can be analysed to obtain the dominant frequencies. \\

As we move closer towards the present day, the periodicity and amplitude is larger which implies more extreme temperature variations so longer glacial-interglacials and a larger change in the global ice volume.}

The periodicities from the data can be obtained by considering the ``hottest'' areas of each of the heat maps (i.e. the red/orange areas). Values for the wavelength can be found with $2^y \times P$, where $y$ is the y-axis height of the hot region, and $P$ is the period of time between the data points. In Table \ref{table:final_results} we summarise the wavelengths which correspond to the dashed-line heights.}

Three dominant signals can be seen as coloured in green, they are defined as the main signals as they have a height greater than the $95\%$ confidence interval (the red curve). The same results can be found in Table \ref{table:final_results}, and comparing to the ``true'' wavelengths we also find similarities which further strengthens the possibility that the Milankovitch-Croll hypothesis has some validity.}
