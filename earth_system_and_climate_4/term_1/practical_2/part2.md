#Part 2: Inferring past climate changes form marine delta-^{18}O data

Plotting the benthic foram delta-^{18}O data, we produce the following graph

- In terms of long-term trends in the data, we find that as the Earth becomes older, there is a greater percentage of delta-^{18}O in the ocean. At 6 Myr there about 3 delta-^{18}O per mille, and if we look at the ‘present day’, the data varies from ~3.5-5 per mille. 

	We could interpret this to mean that the higher amount of delta-^{18}O could be due to more ice melting due to a global climate change, this melted ice would release more of the oxygen isotope into the ocean.

	The variance during the ‘current period’ could be attributed to the fact that we are viewing a data composite. Some parts of the world may not necessarily be releasing the same amount of delta-^{18}O as other parts, hence the variance in the data at 0Myr.

- The higher frequency oscillations can be seen from the 4Myr period to around 6Myr (?) - there are more well defined peaks and troughs as opposed to the younger data. We can estimate that for a 0.5Myr time period there is a change in delta-^{18}O of about 0.5 per mille. 

	For the younger data, it appears the trend is just a straight line curve from 0Myr to 3Myr. We note that from the plot there are also ‘straight line’ features extended from around the peaks and troughs of the later well-defined periods. These appear to be in the younger data as well so we could deduce that there is periodicity still occurring and not just linear trend.
