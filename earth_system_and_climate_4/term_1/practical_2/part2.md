# Part 2: Inferring past climate changes form marine delta-^{18}O data

Plotting the benthic foram delta-^{18}O data, we produce the following graph

![climate_data](part2_graph.pdf)

- In terms of long-term trends in the data, we find that as the Earth becomes older, there is a greater percentage of delta-^{18}O in the ocean. At 6Myr there about 3 delta-^{18}O per mille, and if we look at the ‘present day’, the data varies from ~3.5-5 per mille. 

	We could interpret this to mean that the higher amount of delta-^{18}O could be due to more ice melting due to a global climate change, this melted ice would release more of the oxygen isotope into the ocean.

	The variance during the ‘current period’ could be attributed to the fact that we are viewing a data composite. Some parts of the world may not necessarily be releasing the same amount of delta-^{18}O as other parts, hence the variance in the data at 0Myr.

- The higher frequency oscillations can be seen from the 4Myr period to around 6Myr (?) - there are more well defined peaks and troughs as opposed to the younger data. We can estimate that for a 0.5Myr time period there is a change in delta-^{18}O of about 0.5 per mille. 

	For the younger data, it appears the trend is just a straight line curve from 0Myr to 3Myr. We note that from the plot there are also ‘straight line’ features extended from around the peaks and troughs of the later well-defined periods. These appear to be in the younger data as well so we could deduce that there is periodicity still occurring and not just linear trend.  
- During the 4Myr to 6Myr period there is a more defined sinusoidal profile as opposed to the, within that 2Myr period there appears to be approximately two peaks - it roughly corresponds to around one and a half waves. 

	Looking at the earlier time periods of 0Myr to 4Myr we see that there is no exact wave profile, just a linear line. We cannot easily tell what the relationship might be - just that it is linear and not sinusoidal.
	
- Within the Earth's earlier history we see that the higher frequency oscillations do change in magnitude with time. Although our data is a composite, if we were to collapse it by taking the average we would see that the wave section in the 5Myr to 6Myr period has a slightly higher peak than during the 4Myr to 5Myr section. 

	This could be interpreted as potentially providing an indication of the beginning of the LGM, a change in the climate leading to less delta-^{18}O being released i.e. colder weather leading to the freezing of more water so there would be less of the oxygen isotope within the ocean. 
	
	Then as the climate increases in temperature there would be an increase, we can define this at around 3Myr when the data does not follow a wave-like profile anymore, but a linear trend.  
	
### retried analysis: ability to zoom in on data

- There still appears to be long term trends within the benthic foram data. From 6Myrs ago to 4Myrs ago there appears to be a general sinusoidal change in the d-18O, and from the current epoch to the 4Myr period the general trend appears to be linear - there was a linear increase which could suggest an increase in global temperature. 

- From 6Myr to 4Myr the data has a higher frequency than the earlier periods. There is a visible difference in the number of peaks and thus the number of changes in global temperature. However with the earlier times, the difference in d-18O is larger.  

	From 6Myr to 5Myr there are approximately 25 peaks which accounts for a period of 1Myr/25=0.04Myr.
	
	Then from 4Myr to 5Myr there are roughly 27 peaks which produces a period of 0.0370Myr.
	
	3Myr to 4Myr there are approx 28 peaks so 0.0357Myr for the period.
	
	2Myr to 3Myr there is approx 22 peaks, 0.0455Myr as the time period for a 'cycle'
	
	1Myr to 2Myr there is approx 24 peaks, so 0.0417Myr for the period.
	
	Finally, 0Myr to 1Myr there is approx 17 peaks which produces a period of 0.0588Myr.
	
- Can I pick out a dominant period/frequency during certain time intervals? What does that mean? 

- The lower frequency oscillations are the one which dramatically change in magnitude in time, we could suggest that as we near the current epoch there is a global shift in temperature which allows for the larger variance in d-18O - the ratio between the 18O and 16O.
