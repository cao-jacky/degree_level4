# Part 1: Interpreting marine delta-^{18}O data

1. There is a change of -0.125 in the delta-^{18}O foram shells. There is a negative change of 1.5 for the isotopic deviation.

	The LGM was recent and can be seen as the major ‘dip’ towards the top of the sea core. The gradient of the line from LGM to present surface waters provides us with a rate for each year - this can then be used to calculate the change in delta-^{18}O for a 10m raise. 
2. From LGM to present: there has been a -1% isotopic deviation. Planktonic forams represent temperature and ice volume, whilst benthic forams only provide information about the ice volume content. 

	So if we calculate the change in forams i.e. Delta Planktonic - Delta Benthic, then we can find the change in temperature as a ratio. This can then allow us to calculate a 2.5°C change during the LGM to Holocene. 
	
3. If ice melts then more delta-^{16}O is release into the ocean. Evaporation causes delta-^{16}O to be released out of the ocean into the atmosphere, this would also be the case for some of the delta-^{18}O. 

	So, there would be an overall decrease in the number of delta-^{18}O as evaporation and the melting of ice would cause a decrease.
