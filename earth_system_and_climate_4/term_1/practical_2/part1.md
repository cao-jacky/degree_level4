# Part 1: Interpreting marine delta-^{18}O data

1. There is a change of -0.125 in the delta-^{18}O foram shells. There is a negative change of 1.5 for the isotopic deviation.

	The LGM was recent and can be seen as the major ‘dip’ towards the top of the sea core. The gradient of the line from LGM to present surface waters provides us with a rate for each year - this can then be used to calculate the change in delta-^{18}O for a 10m raise.
