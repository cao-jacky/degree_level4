Oxygen Isotopes
- Using it as a proxy for palaeotemperature
- Proxy used to reconstruct the past: a measureable parameter 
- Using ancient and modern records and comparing them to each other 

- Isotope nomenclature 
	- Heavier isotope vs lighter isotope - expressed as the heavier isotope e.g. delta 18^O
	- There are different standards to calibrate the different ratios and results
	- Ratios are relative to a standard
	- If more positive ratio: enriched (in heavier isotope), heavier, higher, positive
	- If more negative ratio: depleted, lighter, lower, negative

- Rayleigh fractination 
- Isoscapes: maps of isotopic boundaries
	- Can be used to understand the hydrological cycle 
	- Can mathematically predict groundwater delta 18^O 

- Oxygen isotopes are generally in vapour form if they are light, and heavier isotopes are preferentially liquid 
- Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) has a predictable relationship 
	- Can use oxygen ratio to workout the hydrogen value
- delta 18^O vs time is not linear nor sinusoidal, instead it's a complicated curve because of the different origins of water - but the general average stays the same

- Northern Hemisphere, snow melts which contributes to the d 18^O value  c.f. Southern Hemisphere where the snow stays the same
- If in an evaporative basin this leads to a heavier isotope
- Heavier and lighter signals based off different aspects

- In glacial period, more oxygen isotopes are being locked into the ice 
- Water is more 18 enriched during glacial periods as the light oxygen is snowed out to form glaciers
- Assumption of: glacial?, non-glacial?, inter-glacial?
- Some effects on d 18^O:
	- Light cycles
	- Water composition
	- Sample precision
	- Diagenesis
	- Habitat - are they benthic, are the plantic, deep marine? 

- delta_W obtained from Cenozoic d18O record of benthic forams
- Large change in d18O at the cross between Oligocene-Eocene period which was the formation of the Antarctic ice sheets -> look at Zachos et al. (2001)

- d18O is important!!!
