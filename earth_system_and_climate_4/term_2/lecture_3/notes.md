- CO2 controls temperature and global warming (?) - from the d18O data
- 18O in water column controlled by delta_w
	- Salinity, temperatures, evaporation...etc in terms of other processes
	- Amount of CO2 which can be dissolved in the ocean at the time 

- delta_w is really difficult to model 
- Proxies which are independent of delta_w, but can provide a value for temperature 

- Can generate a delta_w from other proxies: magnesium-calcium to produce a model

- Petit et al 1999 shows a relationship between ice ages and CO2
- Increased dust in glacial periods as the atmosphere is dryer
- Ice vs marine 18O records 
- 18O from ice and marine are quite negative

- pCO2 is palaeo-CO2
