Strontium 
- Isotopes with different number of neutrons
- Stable isotopes don't decay, but can be produced from radioactive decay

Earth system
- Tectonic cycle
- Hydrologic cycle
- Rock cycle 

- Long term climate change in the Earth system
- Isotopes to recreate ancient environments

Ratio of 87 to 86 Strontium 
- Modern seawater has a ratio average value of ~0.7092(1_54_) with the last two decimal places are contentious today
- Takes about 1~4 Myr to change the value in seas
- Looking at mass balance equations

- Upper mantle evolution line 
- Present day: more 87^Sr 
- Weathering increases

How strontium is analysed 
1. Increased weather rates
2. Decrease in mantle input 

Organisms exchanging Ca into Sr. Analysing fossils allow to produce an ancient seawater value. 
- 87^Rb weathering leads to a production of 87^Sr
- Weathering and mantle are the effects which change 87^Sr values

What's causing the Phanerozic Sr cycles? 
- Changing of continents
- Glacial-Interglacial cycles -> weathering could decrease in glaciation periods

Assume: modern day belemnites are the 'same' as they were 

European Sr Record/Curve

- Age error is highest in flat bit of the Sr curve
- In high gradient regions, the age can be better constrained
- Resonance time is long so that it takes a long time to change stuff

- The Wilson Cycle: plate tectonics
- European samples could be effected by weathering input
