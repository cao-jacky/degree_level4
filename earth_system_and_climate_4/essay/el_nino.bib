	Abstract = {Super El Ni{\~n}os, the strongest and most powerful of El Ni{\~n}os, impact economies, societies, and ecosystems disproportionately. Despite their importance, we do not fully understand how super El Ni{\~n}os develop their intensity and unique characteristics. Here, combining observational analyses with simple numerical simulations, we suggest that eastern Pacific intensified super El Ni{\~n}os result from the interaction of an El Ni{\~n}o and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole. Further, we identify a self-limiting behavior inherent to El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics. This behavior---a consequence of the atmospheric Kelvin wave response that develops to the east of ENSO's convective anomalies---dampens sea surface temperature (SST) variations in the eastern Pacific, thereby preventing super El Ni{\~n}os from developing through tropical Pacific dynamics alone. Our model explains the features of the large 1972, 1982, and 1997 El Ni{\~n}os; the large SST anomalies during the 2015 El Ni{\~n}o, however, were likely enhanced by strong decadal variability.},

	Abstract = {The existence of two regimes for El Ni{\~{n}}o (EN) events, moderate and strong, has been previously shown in the GFDL CM2.1 climate model and also suggested in observations. The two regimes have been proposed to originate from the nonlinearity in the Bjerknes feedback, associated with a threshold in sea surface temperature ({\$}{\$}T{\_}c{\$}{\$}Tc) that needs to be exceeded for deep atmospheric convection to occur in the eastern Pacific. However, although the recent 2015--16 EN event provides a new data point consistent with the sparse strong EN regime, it is not enough to statistically reject the null hypothesis of a unimodal distribution based on observations alone. Nevertheless, we consider the possibility suggestive enough to explore it with a simple theoretical model based on the nonlinear Bjerknes feedback. In this study, we implemented this nonlinear mechanism in the recharge-discharge (RD) ENSO model and show that it is sufficient to produce the two EN regimes, i.e. a bimodal distribution in peak surface temperature (T) during EN events. The only modification introduced to the original RD model is that the net damping is suppressed when T exceeds {\$}{\$}T{\_}c{\$}{\$}Tc, resulting in a weak nonlinearity in the system. Due to the damping, the model is globally stable and it requires stochastic forcing to maintain the variability. The sustained low-frequency component of the stochastic forcing plays a key role for the onset of strong EN events (i.e. for {\$}{\$}T>T{\_}c{\$}{\$}T>Tc), at least as important as the precursor positive heat content anomaly (h). High-frequency forcing helps some EN events to exceed {\$}{\$}T{\_}c{\$}{\$}Tc, increasing the number of strong events, but the rectification effect is small and the overall number of EN events is little affected by this forcing. Using the Fokker--Planck equation, we show how the bimodal probability distribution of EN events arises from the nonlinear Bjerknes feedback and also propose that the increase in the net feedback with increasing T is a necessary condition for bimodality in the RD model. We also show that the damping strength determines both the adjustment time-scale and equilibrium value of the ensemble spread associated with the stochastic forcing.},

	Abstract = { AbstractThe El Ni{\~n}o of 2015/16 was among the strongest El Ni{\~n}o events observed since 1950 and took place almost two decades after the previous major event in 1997/98. Here, perspectives of the event are shared by scientists from three national meteorological or climate services that issue regular operational updates on the status and prediction of El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Public advisories on the unfolding El Ni{\~n}o were issued in the first half of 2015. This was followed by significant growth in sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, a peak during November 2015--January 2016, subsequent decay, and its demise during May 2016. The life cycle and magnitude of the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o was well predicted by most models used by national meteorological services, in contrast to the generally overexuberant model predictions made the previous year. The evolution of multiple atmospheric and oceanic measures demonstrates the rich complexity of ENSO, as a coupled ocean--atmosphere phenomenon with pronounced global impacts. While some aspects of the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o rivaled the events of 1982/83 and 1997/98, we show that it also differed in unique and important ways, with implications for the study and evaluation of past and future ENSO events. Unlike previous major El Ni{\~n}os, remarkably above-average SST anomalies occurred in the western and central equatorial Pacific but were milder near the coast of South America. While operational ENSO systems have progressed markedly over the past several decades, the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o highlights several challenges that will continue to test both the research and operational forecast communities. },

To investigate this negative/asymmetric feedback, a simple parameterization for the horizontal thermal flux convergence due to TIWs was incorporated into a simple ENSO model.

@article{doi:10.1175/JAS4029.1,
	Abstract = { Abstract Westerly wind bursts (WWBs) in the equatorial Pacific are known to play a significant role in the development of El Ni{\~n}o events. They have typically been treated as a purely stochastic external forcing of ENSO. Recent observations, however, show that WWB characteristics depend upon the large-scale SST field. The consequences of such a WWB modulation by SST are examined using an ocean general circulation model coupled to a statistical atmosphere model (i.e., a hybrid coupled model). An explicit WWB component is added to the model with guidance from a 23-yr observational record. The WWB parameterization scheme is constructed such that the likelihood of WWB occurrence increases as the western Pacific warm pool extends: a ``semistochastic'' formulation, which has both deterministic and stochastic elements. The location of the WWBs is parameterized to migrate with the edge of the warm pool. It is found that modulation of WWBs by SST strongly affects the characteristics of ENSO. In particular, coupled feedbacks between SST and WWBs may be sufficient to transfer the system from a damped regime to one with self-sustained oscillations. Modulated WWBs also play a role in the irregular timing of warm episodes and the asymmetry in the size of warm and cold events in this ENSO model. Parameterizing the modulation of WWBs by an increase of the linear air--sea coupling coefficient seems to miss important dynamical processes, and a purely stochastic representation of WWBs elicits only a weak ocean response. Based upon this evidence, it is proposed that WWBs may need to be treated as an internal part of the coupled ENSO system, and that the detailed knowledge of wind burst dynamics may be necessary to explain the characteristics of ENSO. },
