	Abstract = { AbstractThe El Ni{\~n}o of 2015/16 was among the strongest El Ni{\~n}o events observed since 1950 and took place almost two decades after the previous major event in 1997/98. Here, perspectives of the event are shared by scientists from three national meteorological or climate services that issue regular operational updates on the status and prediction of El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Public advisories on the unfolding El Ni{\~n}o were issued in the first half of 2015. This was followed by significant growth in sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, a peak during November 2015--January 2016, subsequent decay, and its demise during May 2016. The life cycle and magnitude of the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o was well predicted by most models used by national meteorological services, in contrast to the generally overexuberant model predictions made the previous year. The evolution of multiple atmospheric and oceanic measures demonstrates the rich complexity of ENSO, as a coupled ocean--atmosphere phenomenon with pronounced global impacts. While some aspects of the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o rivaled the events of 1982/83 and 1997/98, we show that it also differed in unique and important ways, with implications for the study and evaluation of past and future ENSO events. Unlike previous major El Ni{\~n}os, remarkably above-average SST anomalies occurred in the western and central equatorial Pacific but were milder near the coast of South America. While operational ENSO systems have progressed markedly over the past several decades, the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o highlights several challenges that will continue to test both the research and operational forecast communities. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Using ocean data assimilation products, variability of eastern Pacific Ocean tropical instability waves (TIWs) and their interaction with the El Ni{\~n}o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were analyzed. TIWs are known to heat the cold tongue through horizontal advection. Conversely, variability of the cold tongue influences TIW variability (TIWV). During La Ni{\~n}a, TIWs are more active and contribute to anomalous warming. During El Ni{\~n}o, TIWs are suppressed and induce an anomalous cooling. TIWV thus acts as negative feedback to ENSO. Interestingly, this feedback is stronger during La Ni{\~n}a than during El Ni{\~n}o. To investigate this negative/asymmetric feedback, a simple parameterization for the horizontal thermal flux convergence due to TIWs was incorporated into a simple ENSO model. The model results suggested that asymmetric thermal heating associated with TIWs can explain the El Ni{\~n}o?La Ni{\~n}a asymmetry (with larger-amplitude El Ni{\~n}os).},

	Abstract = { Abstract Westerly wind bursts (WWBs) in the equatorial Pacific are known to play a significant role in the development of El Ni{\~n}o events. They have typically been treated as a purely stochastic external forcing of ENSO. Recent observations, however, show that WWB characteristics depend upon the large-scale SST field. The consequences of such a WWB modulation by SST are examined using an ocean general circulation model coupled to a statistical atmosphere model (i.e., a hybrid coupled model). An explicit WWB component is added to the model with guidance from a 23-yr observational record. The WWB parameterization scheme is constructed such that the likelihood of WWB occurrence increases as the western Pacific warm pool extends: a ``semistochastic'' formulation, which has both deterministic and stochastic elements. The location of the WWBs is parameterized to migrate with the edge of the warm pool. It is found that modulation of WWBs by SST strongly affects the characteristics of ENSO. In particular, coupled feedbacks between SST and WWBs may be sufficient to transfer the system from a damped regime to one with self-sustained oscillations. Modulated WWBs also play a role in the irregular timing of warm episodes and the asymmetry in the size of warm and cold events in this ENSO model. Parameterizing the modulation of WWBs by an increase of the linear air--sea coupling coefficient seems to miss important dynamical processes, and a purely stochastic representation of WWBs elicits only a weak ocean response. Based upon this evidence, it is proposed that WWBs may need to be treated as an internal part of the coupled ENSO system, and that the detailed knowledge of wind burst dynamics may be necessary to explain the characteristics of ENSO. },
