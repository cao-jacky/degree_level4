	Abstract = {A simple analytic model is constructed to elucidate some basic features of the response of the tropical atmosphere to diabatic heating. In particular, there is considerable east-west asymmetry which can be illustrated by solutions for heating concentrated in an area of finite extent. This is of more than academic interest because heating in practice tends to be concentrated in specific areas. For instance, a model with heating symmetric about the equator at Indonesian longitudes produces low-level easterly flow over the Pacific through propagation of Kelvin waves into the region. It also produces low-level westerly inflow over the Indian Ocean (but in a smaller region) because planetary waves propagate there. In the heating region itself the low-level flow is away from the equator as required by the vorticity equation. The return flow toward the equator is farther west because of planetary wave propagation, and so cyclonic flow is obtained around lows which form on the western margins of the heating zone. Another model solution with the heating displaced north of the equator provides a flow similar to the monsoon circulation of July and a simple model solution can also be found for heating concentrated along an inter-tropical convergence line.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The delayed oscillator, the western Pacific oscillator, the recharge?discharge oscillator, and the advective?reflective oscillator have been proposed to interpret the oscillatory nature of the El Ni{\~n}o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO). All of these oscillator models assume a positive ocean?atmosphere feedback in the equatorial eastern and central Pacific. The delayed oscillator assumes that the western Pacific is an inactive region and wave reflection at the western boundary provides a negative feedback for the coupled system to oscillate. The western Pacific oscillator emphasizes an active role of the western Pacific in ENSO. The recharge?discharge oscillator argues that discharge and recharge of equatorial heat content cause the coupled system to oscillate. The advective?reflective oscillator emphasizes the importance of zonal advection associated with wave reflection at both the western and eastern boundaries. Motivated by the existence of these different oscillator models, a unified oscillator model is formulated and derived from the dynamics and thermodynamics of the coupled ocean?atmosphere system. Consistent with ENSO anomaly patterns observed in the tropical Pacific, this oscillator model considers sea surface temperature anomalies in the equatorial eastern Pacific, zonal wind stress anomalies in both the equatorial central Pacific and the equatorial western Pacific, and thermocline depth anomalies in the off-equatorial western Pacific. If the western Pacific wind-forced response is neglected, thermocline and zonal wind stress anomalies in the western Pacific are decoupled from the coupled system, and the unified oscillator reduces to the delayed oscillator. If wave reflection at the western boundary is neglected, the unified oscillator reduces to the western Pacific oscillator. The mathematical form of the recharge?discharge oscillator can also be derived from this unified oscillator. Most of the physics of the advective?reflective oscillator are implicitly included in the unified oscillator, and the negative feedback of wave reflection at the eastern boundary is added to the unified oscillator. With appropriate model parameters chosen to be consistent with those of previous oscillator models, the unified oscillator model oscillates on interannual timescales.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The behavior of a tropical coupled atmosphere/ocean model is analyzed for a range of different background states and ocean geometries. The model is essentially that of Cane and Zebiak for the tropical Pacific, except only temporally constant background states are considered here. For realistic background states and ocean geometry, the model solutions feature oscillations of period of 3?5 yr. By comparing the full model solution with a linearized version of the model, it is shown that the basic mechanism of the oscillation is contained within linear theory. A simple linear analog model is derived that describes the nature of the interannual variability in the coupled tropical atmosphere?ocean system. The analog model highlights the properties that produce coupled atmosphere?ocean instability in the eastern ocean basin, and the equatorial wave dynamics in the western ocean basin that are responsible for a delayed, negative feedback into this instability growth. The growth rate of the local instability c together with the magnitude b and lag of the wave-induced processes determine the nature of the interannual variability displayed in the coupled model. Specifically, these processes determine the growth rate of the coupled system and, when the solutions are oscillatory, the period of the oscillation. The terms b, c, and are set by the background state of the atmosphere and ocean, and the geometry of the ocean basin. The simple analog model is used to design and interpret a set of experiments using the full linear and nonlinear numerical models of the coupled atmosphere ocean system in the Pacific. In these experiments, we examine the effects of the assumed basic state and ocean geometry on the interannual variability of the coupled system. The simple model is shown to be a remarkably good proxy of the full linear and nonlinear numerical models. The limiting nonlinearity in the full numerical model is shown to be the dependence of the temperature of the upward water on the thermocline depth. However, we find the essential processes that describe the local instability growth rate and period of the interannual oscillations in the coupled system are linear. Nonlinearities primarily act as a bound on the amplitude of the final state oscillations, and decrease the period of the firm state oscillations by about 10 percent from that obtained in the small amplitude regime of the full coupled model and the linear analog model. The nonlinear analog model for the full numerical model is derived, and compared with that proposed by Suarez and Schopf. The numerical and analog models help to explain why organized, large amplitude, interannual variability is prominent in the tropical Pacific basin, and not in Atlantic and Indian basins.},

	Abstract = {Super El Ni{\~n}os, the strongest and most powerful of El Ni{\~n}os, impact economies, societies, and ecosystems disproportionately. Despite their importance, we do not fully understand how super El Ni{\~n}os develop their intensity and unique characteristics. Here, combining observational analyses with simple numerical simulations, we suggest that eastern Pacific intensified super El Ni{\~n}os result from the interaction of an El Ni{\~n}o and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole. Further, we identify a self-limiting behavior inherent to El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics. This behavior---a consequence of the atmospheric Kelvin wave response that develops to the east of ENSO's convective anomalies---dampens sea surface temperature (SST) variations in the eastern Pacific, thereby preventing super El Ni{\~n}os from developing through tropical Pacific dynamics alone. Our model explains the features of the large 1972, 1982, and 1997 El Ni{\~n}os; the large SST anomalies during the 2015 El Ni{\~n}o, however, were likely enhanced by strong decadal variability.},

@article{Takahashi2018,
	Abstract = {The existence of two regimes for El Ni{\~{n}}o (EN) events, moderate and strong, has been previously shown in the GFDL CM2.1 climate model and also suggested in observations. The two regimes have been proposed to originate from the nonlinearity in the Bjerknes feedback, associated with a threshold in sea surface temperature ({\$}{\$}T{\_}c{\$}{\$}Tc) that needs to be exceeded for deep atmospheric convection to occur in the eastern Pacific. However, although the recent 2015--16 EN event provides a new data point consistent with the sparse strong EN regime, it is not enough to statistically reject the null hypothesis of a unimodal distribution based on observations alone. Nevertheless, we consider the possibility suggestive enough to explore it with a simple theoretical model based on the nonlinear Bjerknes feedback. In this study, we implemented this nonlinear mechanism in the recharge-discharge (RD) ENSO model and show that it is sufficient to produce the two EN regimes, i.e. a bimodal distribution in peak surface temperature (T) during EN events. The only modification introduced to the original RD model is that the net damping is suppressed when T exceeds {\$}{\$}T{\_}c{\$}{\$}Tc, resulting in a weak nonlinearity in the system. Due to the damping, the model is globally stable and it requires stochastic forcing to maintain the variability. The sustained low-frequency component of the stochastic forcing plays a key role for the onset of strong EN events (i.e. for {\$}{\$}T>T{\_}c{\$}{\$}T>Tc), at least as important as the precursor positive heat content anomaly (h). High-frequency forcing helps some EN events to exceed {\$}{\$}T{\_}c{\$}{\$}Tc, increasing the number of strong events, but the rectification effect is small and the overall number of EN events is little affected by this forcing. Using the Fokker--Planck equation, we show how the bimodal probability distribution of EN events arises from the nonlinear Bjerknes feedback and also propose that the increase in the net feedback with increasing T is a necessary condition for bimodality in the RD model. We also show that the damping strength determines both the adjustment time-scale and equilibrium value of the ensemble spread associated with the stochastic forcing.},

	Abstract = { AbstractThe El Ni{\~n}o of 2015/16 was among the strongest El Ni{\~n}o events observed since 1950 and took place almost two decades after the previous major event in 1997/98. Here, perspectives of the event are shared by scientists from three national meteorological or climate services that issue regular operational updates on the status and prediction of El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Public advisories on the unfolding El Ni{\~n}o were issued in the first half of 2015. This was followed by significant growth in sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, a peak during November 2015--January 2016, subsequent decay, and its demise during May 2016. The life cycle and magnitude of the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o was well predicted by most models used by national meteorological services, in contrast to the generally overexuberant model predictions made the previous year. The evolution of multiple atmospheric and oceanic measures demonstrates the rich complexity of ENSO, as a coupled ocean--atmosphere phenomenon with pronounced global impacts. While some aspects of the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o rivaled the events of 1982/83 and 1997/98, we show that it also differed in unique and important ways, with implications for the study and evaluation of past and future ENSO events. Unlike previous major El Ni{\~n}os, remarkably above-average SST anomalies occurred in the western and central equatorial Pacific but were milder near the coast of South America. While operational ENSO systems have progressed markedly over the past several decades, the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o highlights several challenges that will continue to test both the research and operational forecast communities. },

@article{doi:10.1175/JAS4029.1,
	Abstract = { Abstract Westerly wind bursts (WWBs) in the equatorial Pacific are known to play a significant role in the development of El Ni{\~n}o events. They have typically been treated as a purely stochastic external forcing of ENSO. Recent observations, however, show that WWB characteristics depend upon the large-scale SST field. The consequences of such a WWB modulation by SST are examined using an ocean general circulation model coupled to a statistical atmosphere model (i.e., a hybrid coupled model). An explicit WWB component is added to the model with guidance from a 23-yr observational record. The WWB parameterization scheme is constructed such that the likelihood of WWB occurrence increases as the western Pacific warm pool extends: a ``semistochastic'' formulation, which has both deterministic and stochastic elements. The location of the WWBs is parameterized to migrate with the edge of the warm pool. It is found that modulation of WWBs by SST strongly affects the characteristics of ENSO. In particular, coupled feedbacks between SST and WWBs may be sufficient to transfer the system from a damped regime to one with self-sustained oscillations. Modulated WWBs also play a role in the irregular timing of warm episodes and the asymmetry in the size of warm and cold events in this ENSO model. Parameterizing the modulation of WWBs by an increase of the linear air--sea coupling coefficient seems to miss important dynamical processes, and a purely stochastic representation of WWBs elicits only a weak ocean response. Based upon this evidence, it is proposed that WWBs may need to be treated as an internal part of the coupled ENSO system, and that the detailed knowledge of wind burst dynamics may be necessary to explain the characteristics of ENSO. },
