	Abstract = {Beginning from the hypothesis by Bjerknes {$[$}1969{$]$} that ocean‐atmosphere interaction was essential to the El Ni{\~n}o‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, the Tropical Ocean‐Global Atmosphere (TOGA) decade has not only confirmed this but has supplied detailed theory for mechanisms setting the underlying period and possible mechanisms responsible for the irregularity of ENSO. Essentials of the theory of ocean dynamical adjustment are reviewed from an ENSO perspective. Approaches to simple atmospheric modeling greatly aided development of theory for ENSO atmospheric feedbacks but are critically reviewed for current stumbling blocks for applications beyond ENSO. ENSO theory has benefitted from an unusually complete hierarchy of coupled models of various levels of complexity. Most of the progress during the ENSO decade came from models of intermediate complexity, which are sufficiently detailed to compare to observations and to use in prediction but are less complex than coupled general circulation models. ENSO theory in simple models lagged behind ENSO simulation in intermediate models but has provided a useful role in uniting seemingly diverse viewpoints. The process of boiling ENSO theory down to a single consensus model of all aspects of the phenomenon is still a rapidly progressing area, and theoretical limits to ENSO predictability are still in debate, but a thorough foundation for the discussion has been established in the TOGA decade.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A modified shallow water model with simplified mixed layer dynamics and a sea surface temperature (SST) equation is employed to gain a theoretical understanding of the modes and mechanisms of coupled air-sea interaction in the tropics. Approximations suggested by a scaling analysis are used to obtain analytic results for the eigenmodes of the system. A slow time scale, unstable eigenmode associated with the time derivative of the SST equation is suggested to be important in giving rise to interannual oscillations. This slow SST mode is not necessarily linked to conventional equatorial oceanic wave modes. A useful limit of this mode is explored in which the wave speed of uncoupled oceanic wave modes is fast compared to the time scales that arise from the coupling. This is referred to as the fast-wave limit. The dispersion relationship in this limit is used to present a number of coupled feedback mechanisms, which contribute simultaneously to the instability of the SST mode. It is suggested that interannual oscillations observed in a hybrid coupled general circulation model (HGCM) are related to the slow SST mode. A method of testing applicability of the fast-wave limit in any coupled model through distorted physics experiments is presented. Such experiments with the HGCM are employed to demonstrate that the fast-wave limit is quite a good approximation for interannual oscillations at moderate coupling. It is shown that the time delay associated with oceanic wave propagation across the basin is not essential to the existence of interannual coupled oscillations. Asymptotic expressions are also derived for the eigenvalues of coupled Rossby and Kelvin wave modes in the simple model. The manner in which various coupling mechanisms affect the stability of these modes is discussed and the results are used to explain the behavior of a secondary bifurcation found in the HGCM in terms of coupled Kelvin wave instability. For coupled Rossby and Kelvin modes, various coupling mechanisms oppose one another, suggesting that instability of these modes will be less robust to changes of model parameters and basic state than that of the SST mode, in which all coupling mechanisms tend to give growth.},

Simulations with a linearized coupled ocean-atmosphere model resulted in 3- to 6-year ENSO-like oscillations, with many of the variable model parameters found to be very close to their observed values. This simple model suggests that ocean processes that are ignored or underestimated in the delayed action oscillator theory, such as zonal current convergence, zonal advection of sea surface temperature, and equatorial wave reflection from the eastern ocean boundary, are fundamental to the development of the ENSO, in particular to its manifestations in the central equatorial Pacific.},

The hypothesis emphasizes the importance of off-equator sea surface temperature and sea level pressure variations west of the dateline for initiating equatorial easterly winds over the far western Pacific. These winds compete with westerly winds over the equatorial central Pacific enabling the coupled ocean-atmosphere system to oscillate. Consistent with this hypothesis, an analogical oscillator model is constructed that produces ENSO-like oscillations. The proposed mechanism differs from the delayed oscillator paradigm in that wave reflection at the western boundary is not a necessary condition for the coupled ocean-atmosphere system to oscillate.},

	Abstract = {A simple analytic model is constructed to elucidate some basic features of the response of the tropical atmosphere to diabatic heating. In particular, there is considerable east-west asymmetry which can be illustrated by solutions for heating concentrated in an area of finite extent. This is of more than academic interest because heating in practice tends to be concentrated in specific areas. For instance, a model with heating symmetric about the equator at Indonesian longitudes produces low-level easterly flow over the Pacific through propagation of Kelvin waves into the region. It also produces low-level westerly inflow over the Indian Ocean (but in a smaller region) because planetary waves propagate there. In the heating region itself the low-level flow is away from the equator as required by the vorticity equation. The return flow toward the equator is farther west because of planetary wave propagation, and so cyclonic flow is obtained around lows which form on the western margins of the heating zone. Another model solution with the heating displaced north of the equator provides a flow similar to the monsoon circulation of July and a simple model solution can also be found for heating concentrated along an inter-tropical convergence line.},

@article{Zebiak:1987aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract A coupled atmosphere-ocean model is developed and used to study the ENSO (El Ni\~n/Southern Oscillation) phenomenon. With no anomalous external forcing, the coupled model reproduces certain key features of the observed phenomenon. including the recurrence of warm events at irregular intervals with a preference for three to four years. It is shown that the mean sea surface temperature, wind and ocean current fields determine the characteristic spatial structure of ENSO anomalies. The tendency for phase-locking of anomalies is explained in terms of a variation in coupling strength associated with the annual cycle in the mean fields. Sensitivity studies reveal that both the amplitude and the time of scale of the oscillation are sensitive to several parameters that affect the strength of the atmosphere?ocean coupling. Stronger coupling implies larger oscillations with a longer time scale. A critical element of the model oscilliation is the variability in the equatorial heat content of the upper ocean. Equatorial heat content increases prior to warm events and decreases sharply during the events. A theory for this variability and the associated transitions between the non-El Ni{\~n}o and El Ni{\~n}o states is presented. Implications of the model results for the prediction of El Ni{\~n}o events are discussed.},

	N2 = {Abstract A coupled atmosphere-ocean model is developed and used to study the ENSO (El Ni\~n/Southern Oscillation) phenomenon. With no anomalous external forcing, the coupled model reproduces certain key features of the observed phenomenon. including the recurrence of warm events at irregular intervals with a preference for three to four years. It is shown that the mean sea surface temperature, wind and ocean current fields determine the characteristic spatial structure of ENSO anomalies. The tendency for phase-locking of anomalies is explained in terms of a variation in coupling strength associated with the annual cycle in the mean fields. Sensitivity studies reveal that both the amplitude and the time of scale of the oscillation are sensitive to several parameters that affect the strength of the atmosphere?ocean coupling. Stronger coupling implies larger oscillations with a longer time scale. A critical element of the model oscilliation is the variability in the equatorial heat content of the upper ocean. Equatorial heat content increases prior to warm events and decreases sharply during the events. A theory for this variability and the associated transitions between the non-El Ni{\~n}o and El Ni{\~n}o states is presented. Implications of the model results for the prediction of El Ni{\~n}o events are discussed.},

The model is essentially that of Cane and Zebiak for the tropical Pacific, except only temporally constant background states are considered here. For realistic background states and ocean geometry, the model solutions feature oscillations of period of 3?5 yr. By comparing the full model solution with a linearized version of the model, it is shown that the basic mechanism of the oscillation is contained within linear theory. A simple linear analog model is derived that describes the nature of the interannual variability in the coupled tropical atmosphere?ocean system. The analog model highlights the properties that produce coupled atmosphere?ocean instability in the eastern ocean basin, and the equatorial wave dynamics in the western ocean basin that are responsible for a delayed, negative feedback into this instability growth. The growth rate of the local instability c together with the magnitude b and lag of the wave-induced processes determine the nature of the interannual variability displayed in the coupled model. Specifically, these processes determine the growth rate of the coupled system and, when the solutions are oscillatory, the period of the oscillation. The terms b, c, and are set by the background state of the atmosphere and ocean, and the geometry of the ocean basin. The simple analog model is used to design and interpret a set of experiments using the full linear and nonlinear numerical models of the coupled atmosphere ocean system in the Pacific. In these experiments, we examine the effects of the assumed basic state and ocean geometry on the interannual variability of the coupled system. The simple model is shown to be a remarkably good proxy of the full linear and nonlinear numerical models. The limiting nonlinearity in the full numerical model is shown to be the dependence of the temperature of the upward water on the thermocline depth.

Despite their importance, we do not fully understand how super El Ni{\~n}os develop their intensity and unique characteristics. Here, combining observational analyses with simple numerical simulations, we suggest that eastern Pacific intensified super El Ni{\~n}os result from the interaction of an El Ni{\~n}o and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole. Further, we identify a self-limiting behavior inherent to El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics. This behavior---a consequence of the atmospheric Kelvin wave response that develops to the east of ENSO's convective anomalies---dampens sea surface temperature (SST) variations in the eastern Pacific, thereby preventing super El Ni{\~n}os from developing through tropical Pacific dynamics alone. Our model explains the features of the large 1972, 1982, and 1997 El Ni{\~n}os; the large SST anomalies during the 2015 El Ni{\~n}o, however, were likely enhanced by strong decadal variability.},

@article{Takahashi2018,
	Abstract = {The existence of two regimes for El Ni{\~{n}}o (EN) events, moderate and strong, has been previously shown in the GFDL CM2.1 climate model and also suggested in observations. The two regimes have been proposed to originate from the nonlinearity in the Bjerknes feedback, associated with a threshold in sea surface temperature ({\$}{\$}T{\_}c{\$}{\$}Tc) that needs to be exceeded for deep atmospheric convection to occur in the eastern Pacific. However, although the recent 2015--16 EN event provides a new data point consistent with the sparse strong EN regime, it is not enough to statistically reject the null hypothesis of a unimodal distribution based on observations alone. Nevertheless, we consider the possibility suggestive enough to explore it with a simple theoretical model based on the nonlinear Bjerknes feedback. In this study, we implemented this nonlinear mechanism in the recharge-discharge (RD) ENSO model and show that it is sufficient to produce the two EN regimes, i.e. a bimodal distribution in peak surface temperature (T) during EN events. The only modification introduced to the original RD model is that the net damping is suppressed when T exceeds {\$}{\$}T{\_}c{\$}{\$}Tc, resulting in a weak nonlinearity in the system. Due to the damping, the model is globally stable and it requires stochastic forcing to maintain the variability. The sustained low-frequency component of the stochastic forcing plays a key role for the onset of strong EN events (i.e. for {\$}{\$}T>T{\_}c{\$}{\$}T>Tc), at least as important as the precursor positive heat content anomaly (h). High-frequency forcing helps some EN events to exceed {\$}{\$}T{\_}c{\$}{\$}Tc, increasing the number of strong events, but the rectification effect is small and the overall number of EN events is little affected by this forcing. Using the Fokker--Planck equation, we show how the bimodal probability distribution of EN events arises from the nonlinear Bjerknes feedback and also propose that the increase in the net feedback with increasing T is a necessary condition for bimodality in the RD model. We also show that the damping strength determines both the adjustment time-scale and equilibrium value of the ensemble spread associated with the stochastic forcing.},

	Abstract = { AbstractThe El Ni{\~n}o of 2015/16 was among the strongest El Ni{\~n}o events observed since 1950 and took place almost two decades after the previous major event in 1997/98. Here, perspectives of the event are shared by scientists from three national meteorological or climate services that issue regular operational updates on the status and prediction of El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Public advisories on the unfolding El Ni{\~n}o were issued in the first half of 2015. This was followed by significant growth in sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, a peak during November 2015--January 2016, subsequent decay, and its demise during May 2016. The life cycle and magnitude of the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o was well predicted by most models used by national meteorological services, in contrast to the generally overexuberant model predictions made the previous year. The evolution of multiple atmospheric and oceanic measures demonstrates the rich complexity of ENSO, as a coupled ocean--atmosphere phenomenon with pronounced global impacts. While some aspects of the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o rivaled the events of 1982/83 and 1997/98, we show that it also differed in unique and important ways, with implications for the study and evaluation of past and future ENSO events. Unlike previous major El Ni{\~n}os, remarkably above-average SST anomalies occurred in the western and central equatorial Pacific but were milder near the coast of South America. While operational ENSO systems have progressed markedly over the past several decades, the 2015/16 El Ni{\~n}o highlights several challenges that will continue to test both the research and operational forecast communities. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Using ocean data assimilation products, variability of eastern Pacific Ocean tropical instability waves (TIWs) and their interaction with the El Ni{\~n}o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were analyzed. TIWs are known to heat the cold tongue through horizontal advection. Conversely, variability of the cold tongue influences TIW variability (TIWV). During La Ni{\~n}a, TIWs are more active and contribute to anomalous warming. During El Ni{\~n}o, TIWs are suppressed and induce an anomalous cooling. TIWV thus acts as negative feedback to ENSO. Interestingly, this feedback is stronger during La Ni{\~n}a than during El Ni{\~n}o. To investigate this negative/asymmetric feedback, a simple parameterization for the horizontal thermal flux convergence due to TIWs was incorporated into a simple ENSO model. The model results suggested that asymmetric thermal heating associated with TIWs can explain the El Ni{\~n}o?La Ni{\~n}a asymmetry (with larger-amplitude El Ni{\~n}os).},

	N2 = {Abstract Using ocean data assimilation products, variability of eastern Pacific Ocean tropical instability waves (TIWs) and their interaction with the El Ni{\~n}o?Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were analyzed. TIWs are known to heat the cold tongue through horizontal advection. Conversely, variability of the cold tongue influences TIW variability (TIWV). During La Ni{\~n}a, TIWs are more active and contribute to anomalous warming. During El Ni{\~n}o, TIWs are suppressed and induce an anomalous cooling. TIWV thus acts as negative feedback to ENSO. Interestingly, this feedback is stronger during La Ni{\~n}a than during El Ni{\~n}o. To investigate this negative/asymmetric feedback, a simple parameterization for the horizontal thermal flux convergence due to TIWs was incorporated into a simple ENSO model. The model results suggested that asymmetric thermal heating associated with TIWs can explain the El Ni{\~n}o?La Ni{\~n}a asymmetry (with larger-amplitude El Ni{\~n}os).},

	Abstract = { Abstract Westerly wind bursts (WWBs) in the equatorial Pacific are known to play a significant role in the development of El Ni{\~n}o events. They have typically been treated as a purely stochastic external forcing of ENSO. Recent observations, however, show that WWB characteristics depend upon the large-scale SST field. The consequences of such a WWB modulation by SST are examined using an ocean general circulation model coupled to a statistical atmosphere model (i.e., a hybrid coupled model). An explicit WWB component is added to the model with guidance from a 23-yr observational record. The WWB parameterization scheme is constructed such that the likelihood of WWB occurrence increases as the western Pacific warm pool extends: a ``semistochastic'' formulation, which has both deterministic and stochastic elements. The location of the WWBs is parameterized to migrate with the edge of the warm pool. It is found that modulation of WWBs by SST strongly affects the characteristics of ENSO. In particular, coupled feedbacks between SST and WWBs may be sufficient to transfer the system from a damped regime to one with self-sustained oscillations. Modulated WWBs also play a role in the irregular timing of warm episodes and the asymmetry in the size of warm and cold events in this ENSO model. Parameterizing the modulation of WWBs by an increase of the linear air--sea coupling coefficient seems to miss important dynamical processes, and a purely stochastic representation of WWBs elicits only a weak ocean response. Based upon this evidence, it is proposed that WWBs may need to be treated as an internal part of the coupled ENSO system, and that the detailed knowledge of wind burst dynamics may be necessary to explain the characteristics of ENSO. },
